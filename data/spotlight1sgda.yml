  Now in its fourth edition, <strong>Saadhana</strong> is the signature annual event of the <strong>Shreyasi Gopinath Dance Academy</strong>. The festival features performances that showcase stories from our mythology, with oral narrative transformed using music and dance as a form of expression.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Saadhana</i>, meaning a dedicated and disciplined way of learning, also means practice, hard work, resilience and single-mindedness, attributes that will be incorporated in the performances.<br>
  <br> 
  Founded in 2014, the <strong>SGDA</strong> imparts training to beginners, adults, seniors and the differently-abled at three prominent locations in the National Capital Region. Online teaching sessions are also conducted, for students from USA, France, Russia, UAE and Mexico.
